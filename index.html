            <figure>
                <!-- for flexing the elements below into comun with header-->
                <p>Hi there! I’m Mujtaba, a 24 year old Technical Analyst from London, UK. I have a BSc in Business Management and Economics from the University of Roehampton, as well as a MSc in Entrepreneurship from the University of Surrey.</p>
                <p>I am working to start career in Data Science and AI, and I am thoroughly enjoying picking up the latest tech skills along the way. I am currently undergoing training <a link to _Nology> to give me a solid foundation in the industry, learning everything from web development to creating analytical reports, and everything in between. In my own time I am learning T-SQL for SSMS and Python via Udemy courses, and have acquired a certification in Azure Cloud Fundamentals.</p>
                <p>Prior to this I was working with Enterprise Rent-a-Car as a Management Trainee where I helped manage the flagship Heathrow branch. This challenging environment gave me a deep understanding of how the different functions of a business interact to generate value for the company and the customer. I also have experience in crowdfunding and entrepreneurial consultation from my university degrees.</p>
                <p>I think being well rounded is important and to that end I have learned Arabic to an intermediate level. In addition to my native language Urdu, I hope to get a few more under my belt to actualise my dream of becoming a polyglot! I also enjoy skateboarding, practicing martial arts, painting, and reading… a lot. </p>

                    <p>I am enrolled in an intensive 6-week Technical Analyst training course with _nology. They help people from various career backgrounds enter the booming field of IT by providing all the skills they need to get a firm foot in the door.</p>
                    <p>The course teaches technical skills in development and data analytics, best practices and methodologies to use in projects, key business skills, and even interview techniques. After the course is completed, I will be working with _Nology’s reputable clients for a period of 18 months. My general progress updates are below:</p>
